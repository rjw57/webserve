# A Brain Dead Webserver in Go

This is pretty much the most simple webserver one could write in Go. When run,
it will serve the local directory on port 8080 until killed.

## Installation

Use the ``go`` command:

```console
$ go get github.com/rjw57/webserve
```

Ans that's it. Change to the directory you want to serve from and run:

```console
$ webserve
```
